# Tutorial 1: Window Creation  

## OpenGL Overview  

OpenGL is a programming library for 2D and 3D graphics. Despite originally being written for C (and later both C and C++), it is now available in many programming languages like Java(JOGL), Python(PyOpenGL) and HTML-JavaScript(WebGL)(OpenGL ES), which have similar functions.  But here C++ will be the programming language of focus. How the OpenGL renders things and concepts like the graphics pipeline will be shown along the way.  

## Tutorial Prerequisites  

For this tutorial you require:-  
1. Either FreeGLUT or GLFW  
2. GLEW  
3. C++ Compiler  

## Creating a Window  

OpenGL, sadly, does not provide any function for window creation. So you need libraries like GLFW or FreeGLUT to do it. It can be done manually, but it is just a huge chaos, waste of time and platform specific APIs.  

Which one out of the two is up to you. FreeGLUT gives a variety of features for window creation, and even to some extent, mesh, font and image rendering and can be used easily for simple graphics. GLFW gives very advanced features for window creation, and the older versions also gave support for image processing, multithreading (now useless because of `std::thread`), and can be used for complex applications. These complex features can be achieved using FreeGLUT, but it is more straightforward with GLFW. FreeGLUT comes under MIT license while GLFW comes under zlib license, and both the licenses are permissive. Also, you can use other APIs like SDL, SFML, Qt (not recommended due to GPLv3, and paid for commercial use) for window creation, but in this tutorial you won't see how to do it with them.  

Just type the following code to create a window.  

FreeGLUT:  

```c++
// OpenGL
#include <GL/glew.h>
#include <GL/gl.h>
#include <GL/glext.h>
// FreeGLUT
#include <GL/glut.h>
#include <GL/freeglut.h>
// Standard Libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void display() {}

void draw() {
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  display();
  glutSwapBuffers();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  glutInit(&argc, argv); // initialise FreeGLUT
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB|GLUT_DOUBLE);
  glutInitWindowSize(width, height); // set your own width and height - both are int
  glutCreateWindow(title); // set your own title - char*
  glutDisplayFunc(draw);
  glutMainLoop();
  return 0;
}
```  

GLFW:  

```c++
// OpenGL
#include <GL/glew.h>
// GLFW
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h> // For Linux/MacOS users, you may require <GLFW/glfw.h> instead.
// Standard Libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void display() {}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  GLFWWindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(width, height, title, NULL, NULL); // function to create a window, set the last 2 parameters null for now
  glfwMakeContextCurrentWindow(window); // takes the window on focus
  while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    display();
    glfwSwapBuffers(window);
    glfwPollEvents();
  }
  glfwTerminate();
}
```
