# Tutorial 1: Window Creation  

## OpenGL Overview  

OpenGL is a programming library for 2D and 3D graphics. Despite originally being written for C (and later both C and C++), it is now available in many programming languages like Java(JOGL), Python(PyOpenGL) and HTML-JavaScript(WebGL)(OpenGL ES), which have similar functions.  But here C++ will be the programming language of focus. How the OpenGL renders things and concepts like the graphics pipeline will be shown along the way.  

## Tutorial Prerequisites  

For this tutorial you require:-  
1. Library for Window Creation (FreeGLUT most preferred, GLFW second most preferred, when it comes to this tutorial. Other libraries can be used, but then you have to search a bit on internet, it won't be found here.)  
2. OpenGL Loading Library (GLEW, GLAD, GL Load etc. This tutorial will use GLEW.)  
3. C++ Compiler (GCC(for Linux and Mac, for Windows use MinGW, MinGW-w64 or Cygwin), MSVC, Clang etc. unless and until you know how to compile and link with it)  
4. Good knowledge of C and C++  
5. Adequate knowledge of how compilers, linkers, libraries, headers etc. work in C++  

## Creating a Window  

OpenGL, sadly, does not provide any function for window creation. So you need libraries like GLFW or FreeGLUT to do it. It can be done manually, but it is just a huge chaos, waste of time and platform specific APIs.  

Which one out of the two is up to you. FreeGLUT gives a variety of features for window creation, and even to some extent, mesh, font and image rendering and can be used easily for simple graphics. GLFW gives very advanced features for window creation, and the older versions also gave support for image processing, multithreading (now almost useless because of `std::thread`), and can be used for complex applications. These complex features can be achieved using FreeGLUT, but it is more straightforward with GLFW. FreeGLUT comes under MIT license while GLFW comes under zlib license, and both the licenses are permissive. Also, you can use other APIs like OpenGLUT (based on FreeGLUT), SDL, SFML, Qt (not recommended due to GPLv3, and paid for commercial use), wxWidgets for window creation, but in this tutorial you won't see how to do it with them.

[FreeGLUT Docs](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/docs/api.php) Note: You may have to refer GLUT docs for GLUT functions the uses of which are unchanged in FreeGLUT.

[GLFW Docs](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/)

## Loading OpenGL Functions  

OpenGL, again sadly, is not fully supported by default. At least on Windows, it does not support any greater version than 1.1, which is never recommended to be used, unless the application dates too old. So you need a loading library to get the functions and facilities from later and more recent versions of OpenGL. There are many libraries for this purpose. There comes GLEW, which is very popular, and GLAD, which is equally popular, and also others like GL Load, GL3W (only for core contexts) and so on.  

## First Application  

Just type the following code to create an OpenGL context with FreeGLUT or GLFW and load OpenGL functions.  

FreeGLUT:  

```c++
// OpenGL
#include <GL/glew.h> // Don't forget glew.h is to be included before any other OpenGL header, else it will give a bunch of headers while initialising.
#include <GL/gl.h>
#include <GL/glext.h>
// FreeGLUT
#include <GL/glut.h>
#include <GL/freeglut.h>
// Standard Libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void init() {}

void draw() {
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  // code
  glutSwapBuffers();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  glutInit(&argc, argv); // initialise FreeGLUT
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB|GLUT_DOUBLE);
  glutInitWindowSize(width, height); // set your own width and height - both are int
  glutCreateWindow(title); // set your own title - char*
  init()
  glutDisplayFunc(draw);
  glutMainLoop();
  return 0;
}
```  

GLFW:  

```c++
// OpenGL
#include <GL/glew.h>
// GLFW
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h> // For Linux/MacOS users, you may require <GLFW/glfw.h> instead.
// Standard Libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void init() {}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  GLFWWindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(width, height, title, NULL, NULL); // function to create a window, set the last 2 parameters null for now
  glfwMakeContextCurrentWindow(window); // takes the window on focus
  init()
  while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    // code
    glfwSwapBuffers(window);
    glfwPollEvents();
  }
  glfwTerminate();
}
```  
## Installing, Compiling and Linking  
For a general idea use [this](http://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e20068/teaching/i3dg&a/2016/compiling.html). For MSVC just install the package straightaway from website. After installing link the `.lib` files (and `.dll` for dynamic linking) which come with installation. For MinGW use the steps written [here](https://medium.com/@bhargav.chippada/how-to-setup-opengl-on-mingw-w64-in-windows-10-64-bits-b77f350cea7e) (it is a very good article, and it explains neatly). For Cygwin use the steps written [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14346) (it can help noobs, but not sure whether it means GLUT or FreeGLUT). For Linux(especially Ubuntu and Fedora) [this](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~vplab/courses/CG/opengl_start.html) may be helpful, or maybe even [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/859501/learning-opengl-in-ubuntu)(especially Ubuntu). For such GCC based compilers, add `-lglew32 -lopengl32 -lfreeglut -lglu32` for dynamic linking and `-static -lglew32 -lfreeglut_static -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm -lglu32` for static linking on Windows, and `-lglut -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW` on Linux. [This question](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-set-up-OpenGL-on-a-Mac) may be helpful for Mac users, and [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65802625/develop-using-opengl-4-x-on-osx-big-sur) for anybody developing for app store.
