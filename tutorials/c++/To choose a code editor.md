# To choose a code editor  
There can be various choices on how to choose a text editor, and the ultimate preference is up to the developer. And here is a guide to help it.  
## Atom  
### Owner: Microsoft, formerly GitHub  
### License: MIT License
This is a cross platform code editor written in Electron which has a highly customisable user interface and is highly extensible and has a large community. Packages add a good amount of functionality, which adds a lot of features in it, like linting, syntax, liver server, tabbed terminal, color picker, formatting JavaScript, markdown to PDF etc. and themes add style to its user interface. Currently it has around 12,500 packages and 3,000 themes. Its user interface is good, with a tabbed layout and at the left a pane to manage project files. Ctrl-Shift-P opens command palette. It has a huge set of features like Git and GitHub integration, snippets, autocomplete, markdown preview etc. coming inbuilt through preinstalled packages.  
## Visual Studio Code  
### Owner: Microsoft  
### License: MIT License  
This is a cross platform code editor written in Electron which has a very customisable user interface and is very extensible (both comparable to but not as much as Atom) and has a large community (larger than Atom). Extensions add a good amount of functionality, which adds a lot of features in it, like themes, linting, syntax, liver server, intellisense, color picker, formatting code, building program, markdown preview, markdown to PDF etc. Currently, it has around 30,000 extensions. Its user interface is excellent with a styled tab layout and at the left a ribbon with options to manage extensions, project files, git repositories and editor settings. F1 key or Ctrl-Shift-P opens command palette. It has many features like tabbed terminal, autocomplete etc. coming inbuilt.
