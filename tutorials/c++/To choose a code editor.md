# To choose a code editor  
There can be various choices on how to choose a text editor, and the ultimate preference is up to the developer. And here is a guide to help it.  
# Professional  
## Atom  
### Owner: Microsoft, formerly GitHub  
### License: MIT License
### Speed: Slow to Medium  
### Supported Programming Language Syntaxes: 68  
This is a cross platform code editor written in Electron which has a highly customisable user interface and is highly extensible and has a large community.  It has a huge set of features like Git and GitHub integration, snippets, autocomplete, markdown preview, settings GUI etc. coming inbuilt through preinstalled packages. Packages add a good amount of functionality, which adds a lot of features in it, like keybindings, linting, syntax, liver server, tabbed terminal, color picker, formatting JavaScript, markdown to PDF etc. and themes add style to its user interface. Currently it has around 12,500 packages and 3,000 themes. Its user interface is good, with a classic menu layout with File, Edit, View, Selection, Find, Packages and Help tabs and at the left a pane to manage project files. Ctrl-Shift-P opens command palette.  
Note: Sadly such a good editor and all its packages will be archived on December 15 2022.  
## Visual Studio Code  
### Owner: Microsoft  
### License: MIT License  
### Speed: Medium  
### Supported Programming Language Syntaxes: 75  
This is a cross platform code editor written in Electron which has a very customisable user interface and is very extensible (both comparable to but not as much as Atom) and has a large community (larger than Atom). It has many features like Git and GitHub Integration (less than Atom), tabbed terminal, autocomplete, settings GUI etc. coming inbuilt. Extensions add a good amount of functionality, which adds a lot of features in it, like keybindings, themes, linting, syntax, liver server, intellisense, color picker, formatting code, building program, markdown preview, markdown to PDF etc. Currently, it has around 30,000 extensions. Its user interface is excellent with a styled menu layout with File, Edit, Selection, View, Go, Run, Terminal and Help tabs and at the left a ribbon with options to manage extensions, project files, git repositories and editor settings. F1 key or Ctrl-Shift-P opens command palette.  
# Simple  
## Gedit  
### Owner: GNU  
### License: GPLv2+  
### Supported Programming Language Syntaxes: 143  
This is a code editor for Linux and MacOS (and optionally for Windows through MSYS2) written in GTK 3 and is simple yet powerful. It has only 11 plugins bundled though. But they all provide basic important features like Python console, snippets, document statistics etc. And a customised style can also be added. Because of the GTK, it has a excellent user interface, with "New Window", "Quick Open...", "Save As...", "Save All", "Find...", "Find and Replace...", "Clear Highlight", "Go to Line...", "View", "Tools", "Preferences", "Keyboard Shortcuts", "Help" and "About Text Editor" options in the menu (and refresh, print and fullscreen) and other options for opening files, new tabs and saving files on the bar at the top.  
## Notepad++  
### Owner: Don Ho  
### License: GPLv3+, GPv2+ (until v7.9.2)  
### Supported Programming Language Syntaxes: 72  
This is a code editor for Windows (and optionally for Linux through Wine) written in C++, and is simple yet powerful and very fast. Currently, it has around 105 plugins only officially and are merely some dynamic link libraries. Others have to be installed as DLLs separately and manually added, which has to be done in the 64-bit version to get a community mmaintained color picker (there is no inbuilt). It has a simple classic user interface with a classic menu layout with File, Edit, Search, View, Encoding, Language, Settings, Tools, Macro, Run, Plugins, Window and ? tabs and below that some icon shortcuts to them.  
## Notepadqq  
### Owner: Daniel di Sarli  
### License: GPLv3+  
This is an almost complete replacement to Notepad++ for Linux and MacOS, with slight changes. written in C++ and JavaScript.
