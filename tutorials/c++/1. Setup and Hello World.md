# C++ Tutorial  
## What is C++  
C++ is an object oriented and procedural programming language. Some of its common aspects are:  
1. Great level of flexibility and features: C++ is very flexible, and can work at a very low level as well as a very high level, which is why it is commonly used along with C in building operating system kernels. Also, modern versions of C++ have improved it a lot, with additional features like anonymous functions, multithreading, regular expressions, various improvements in standard template library, partial support for dynamic typing, partial support for garbage collection and so on.  
2. Compatibility with C: C++ is highly compatible with C and so many libraries built for C also work with C++.  
3. Huge community: C++ has a huge community and therefore has many libraries to help programming in it, common ones of them licensed under less restrictive licenses may be SFML and Allegro for 2D graphics, Irrlicht and Ogre for 3D graphics, OpenAL soft for Audio files, ImageMagick and STB for image loading, and GLFW and FreeGLUT for OpenGL window creation (OpenGL is a 3D graphics API for C and C++, it offers lower level control than rendering engines, and there is Vulkan, which offers even lower level control).  
4. Interoperability with Python and Java: Java is made in C++, and can be used with C++ through Java Native Interface, and Python is written in C, but it can be used with C++ also, through libraries like `pythonXY.lib`, `_tkinter.lib` etc. and headers like `python.h` which come with the installation. Python also has Cython and modules like `ctypes` which help integrate C++ and Python.
