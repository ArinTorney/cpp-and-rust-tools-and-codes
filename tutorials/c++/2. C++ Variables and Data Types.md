# C++ Data Types  
## Introduction  
In a programming language, there are variables, which are bits of memory used to store data. Each of the variable is of a specific type, and is called a data type. These tell the compiler(interpreter in case of Python, Ruby etc.) how to read the data.  
## Data Types  
Before we go into the detail of variables, let us start with data types. There are 3 types of data types in C++:  
### Primitive Data Types  
These data types are built-in and can be directly used to declare variables.
