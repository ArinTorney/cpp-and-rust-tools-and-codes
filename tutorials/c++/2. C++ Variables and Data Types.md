# C++ Data Types  
## Introduction  
In a programming language, there are variables, which are bits of memory used to store data. Each of the variable is of a specific type, and is called a data type. These tell the compiler(interpreter in case of Python, Ruby etc.) how to read the data.  
## Data Types  
Before we go into the detail of variables, let us start with data types. There are 3 types of data types in C++:  
### Primitive Data Types  
These data types are built-in and can be directly used to declare variables. This is the table of primitive data types in C++. (Note: The sizes many differ slightly, but they are very similar.)  
| Common Name | C++ Name | Size(bytes) |  
|-------------|----------|------|
| Signed Very Short Integer | signed char | 1 |  
| Signed Short Integer | short | 2 |  
| Signed Medium-length Integer | int or long | 4 |  
| Signed Long Integer | long long | 8 |  
| Unsigned Very Short Integer | unsigned char | 1 |  
| Unsigned Short Integer | unsigned short | 2 |  
| Unsigned Medium-length Integer | unsigned int or unsigned long | 4 |  
| Unsigned Long Integer | unsigned long long | 8 |  
| Decimal/Floating Point Single-precision | float | 4 |  
| Decimal/Floating Point Double-precision | double | 8 |  
| Decimal/Floating Point High-precision | long double | >8 |  
| Character | char | 1 |  
| Wide Character | wchar_t | 2 or 4 |  
| UTF-8 Character (C++20) | char8_t | 1 |  
| UTF-16 Character (C++20) | char16_t | 2 |  
| UTF-32 Character (C++20) | char32_t | 4 |  
| Boolean | bool | 1 |  
| Empty/Void | void | 0 |
