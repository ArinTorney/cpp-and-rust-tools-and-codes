# C++ Data Types  
## Introduction  
In a programming language, there are variables, which are bits of memory used to store data. Each of the variable is of a specific type, and is called a data type. These tell the compiler(interpreter in case of Python, Ruby etc.) how to read the data.  
## Data Types  
Before we go into the detail of variables, let us start with data types. There are 3 types of data types in C++:  
### Primitive Data Types  
These data types are built-in and can be directly used to declare variables.  
| Common Name | C++ Name | Size(bytes) | Notes |  
|-------------|----------|------|-------|
| Signed Very Short Integer | signed char | 1 | |  
| Signed Short Integer | short | 2 | |  
| Signed Medium-length Integer | int or long | 4 | |  
| Signed Long Integer | long long | 8 | |  
| Unsigned Very Short Integer | unsigned char | 1 | |  
| Unsigned Short Integer | unsigned short | 2 | |  
| Unsigned Medium-length Integer | unsigned int or unsigned long | 4 | |  
| Unsigned Long Integer | unsigned long long | 8 | |
