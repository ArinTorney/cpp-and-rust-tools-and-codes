# Important Data Types in C++  
## Revision and Basics  
We know that we initialise a data type in C++ like  
<pre><em>typename identifier</em> = <em>value</em>;</pre>  
Their value can be changed later with  
<pre><em>identifier </em>=<em> newValue</em>;</pre> (Note: Whitespaces in operators are ignored in C++.)  
They can even be declared without assigning a value, and be later assigned to.  
<pre><em>typename identifier</em>;</pre>  
## Primitive Data Types  
### Integer Types  
Integer types can be assigned with any number as we write normally. For example,  
<pre>int x = 10;
uint16_t _short = 1234;
long x_long = 10;</pre>  
Instead of decimal literals, they can even be assigned to octal, hexadecimal or binary(C++14) literals. For example,  
<pre>int _1 = 0b101101000000;  // binary      (0b or 0B)
int _2 = 05500;           // octal       (0)
int _3 = 0xb40;           // hexadecimal (0x or 0X) (Note: Alphabets in hexadecimal literals are case-sensitive.)</pre>  
They can also be assigned with literal suffixes (C++11), usually for clarity and in some cases, a simpler alternative to typecasting(later). For example  
<pre>long variable = 12L</pre>  
u or U is the suffix for `unsigned int`, `unsigned long` or `unsigned long long`. l or L is used for `long` or `long long` or their unsigned variants. ll or LL is used for `long long` or its unsigned variant.  
### Decimal/Floating Point Types  
Floating point types `float`, `double` and `long double` can be assigned with any decimal point number, which are called floating point literals. Optionally they can also be assigned with hexadecimal literals.  
<pre>double x = 123.5 // 123.5
double _x = 1.e-5; // 0.00001 (= 1 * 10^-5)
float __x = 0x1.p-5f; // 0.00001 (= 1 * 10^-5)
long double ___x = 0x3.5fp0; // 3.37109 (= 3.37109 * 10^0 (i.e. 1))
</pre>  
There can also be an exponent i.e. power of 10 given to the number. In decimal literals it is completely optional, but e or E is used whenever required. In hexadecimal literals it is mandatory, maybe for lexing and parsing (f is a hex digit, which is also the symbol for floating point literal), and p or P is used (e is a hex digit). `float` literals use f or F and `long double` literals use l or L.
