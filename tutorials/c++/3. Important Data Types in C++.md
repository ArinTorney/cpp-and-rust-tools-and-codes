# Important Data Types in C++  
## Revision and Basics  
We know that we initialise a data type in C++ like  
<pre><em>typename identifier</em> = <em>value</em>;</pre>  
Their value can be changed later with  
<pre><em>identifier </em>=<em> newValue</em>;</pre> (Note: Whitespaces in operators are ignored in C++.)  
They can even be declared without assigning a value, and be later assigned to.  
<pre><em>typename identifier</em>;</pre>  
## Primitive Data Types  
### Integer Types  
Integer types can be assigned with any number as we write normally. For example,  
<pre>int x = 10;
uint16_t _short = 1234;
long x_long = 10;</pre>  
Instead of decimal literals, they can even be assigned to octal, hexadecimal or binary(C++14) literals. For example,  
<pre>int _1 = 0b101101000000;  // binary      (0b or 0B)
int _2 = 05500;           // octal       (0)
int _3 = 0xb40;           // hexadecimal (0x or 0X) (Note: Alphabets in hexadecimal literals are case-sensitive.)</pre>  
They can also be assigned with literals (C++11) usualy for clarity and in some cases, a simpler alternative to typecasting(later). For example  
<pre>long variable = 12L</pre>  
u or U is the literal for `unsigned int`, unsigned long` or `unsigned long long`. l or L is used for `long` or `long long` or their unsigned variants. ll or LL is used for `long long` or its unsigned variant.
