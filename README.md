# Personal Vote about C++ and Rust  
### C++  
C++ version commented here about:
Verbose: C++14 + almost everything of C++17 + some of C++20  
To the point: Supported by GCC 9 and Clang 9  
C++ is outstanding. One of the main points I love about it is flexibility. C++ is an object oriented, functional, procedural etc. programming language and it allows for various syntaxes of features such categories of programming language usually support. There are various such features like anonymous functions, templates, goto, classes and many more, and the list keeps increasing with every standard. Some of these like goto, multiple inheritence, raw pointers, preprocessor defines for constants (now safer with `constexpr`) are criticised for being unsafe, but they too are really useful at some in fact many cases. While a bad programmer may criticise these features and result in bad unsafe code, a good one will always take advantage of them at the right place and get good, clean code. Another feature of C++ is a huge standard library, which supports a lot many algorithms. Things like containers, strings, smart pointers help write C++ code easily while at the same time contributing to memory safety. Another major feature is compatibility with C. A piece of C code can be made compatible with C++ with very few (almost always no) changes to it. So along with its own benefits, C++ also offers almost all of of the benefits and features of C.  
### Rust  
Rust version commented here about: 1.62.0 Complete  
Rust is excellent
